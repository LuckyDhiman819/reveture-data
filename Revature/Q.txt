A Servlet is a Java class that takes incoming requests, processes them, and generates a response to send 
back to the user.
 
The Servlet container is the component of an application server that interacts with Java servlets and is 
responsible for managing the execution of servlets and JSP pages for Java applications.

There are three life cycle methods of a Servlet :
init()
service()
destroy()

The <servlet> element is used to declare the servlet name, the fully-qualified class name of the servlet, 
and any initialization parameters. The name for every servlet must be unique across the deployment descriptor.

The <servlet-mapping> element is used to specify a URL pattern, and the name of the servlet which handles requests whose URL matches the given pattern. The URL pattern uses an asterisk (*) at the beginning or end of the pattern to 
indicate zero or more of any character.

The web.xml file defines mappings between URL paths and the servlets that will handle requests with those paths

doGet() shall be used when small amount of data and insensitive data like a query has to be sent as a request. 
doPost() shall be used when comparatively large amount of sensitive data has to be sent. 

ServletConfig is an object containing some initial parameters or configuration information created by Servlet Container and passed to the 
servlet during initialization.

ServletContext is the object created by Servlet Container to share initial parameters or configuration information to the whole application.


A cookie is a small piece of information that is persisted between the multiple client requests.
